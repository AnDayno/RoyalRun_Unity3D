# Royal Run (3D)

A physics-driven runner where you dodge hazards on a shaky bridge and push for a new high score.  
Built while following GameDev.tv’s **Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D** tutorial: https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2/

## 🎮 Gameplay
- **Player Experience:** Dodge physics-based obstacles on a wobbling bridge
- **Core Mechanic:** Procedurally generated path packed with hazards
- **Game Loop:** Survive as long as possible, using **power-ups** and **checkpoints** to extend your run

## ✨ Features
- Procedural level generation (tiles/segments)
- Rigidbody physics with tuned **physics materials**
- Dynamic hazards (falling objects, movers, knockbacks)
- Checkpoints & power-ups
- Score / distance HUD and basic SFX/VFX
- Animator transitions for smooth character states

## 🕹️ Controls
- **Move Left / Right:** A / D or ← / →  
- **Jump / Dodge:** Space 

> Note: Exact bindings may vary by branch; see `Input` settings in the project.

## 📚 What I’m Practicing
- Procedural generation patterns  
- Rigidbody physics & collision handling  
- Physics materials (friction/bounce)  
- Animator state machines & transitions  
- Inspector attributes & clean component design  
- Lots of C#: lists, inheritance, dependency injection, and new keywords

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnDayno/RoyalRun_Unity3D.git
   cd royal-run
